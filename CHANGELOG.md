# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]
- Add `examples/` directory with runnable scripts for invoice, receipt, and meeting-notes extraction.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-16
- Accept `http://` URLs in addition to `https://`; previously, plain-HTTP URLs were silently treated as local file paths.
- Raise `UrlFetchError` on non-2xx responses; previously, the HTML error body was passed to the LLM as media bytes.
- Follow HTTP redirects when fetching URLs and apply a 30-second timeout.
- Fall back to the response `Content-Type` header when the URL has no recognizable extension (e.g., `/download?id=42`).
- Reach 100% test coverage and enforce the threshold in CI.
- Remove `configure_logging` from `__all__` — it was never defined, breaking `from openextract import *`.
- Fix `extract()` docstring (`url` → `input_file`) and add type hints to `_get_media`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-05
- Add Ollama model support.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-11
